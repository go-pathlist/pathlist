Package pathlist manipulates lists of filepaths joined by the OS-specific
ListSeparator (pathlists), usually found in PATH or GOPATH environment
variables.
It complements the functionality of the standard path/filepath package with:
 - creating a pathlist from individual filepaths (New)
 - extending a pathlist with an individual filepath (AppendTo/PrependTo)
