Package pathlist manipulates lists of filepaths joined by the OS-specific
ListSeparator (pathlists), usually found in PATH or GOPATH environment
variables.
It complements the functionality of the standard path/filepath package with:
 - New: create a pathlist from individual filepaths.
 - AppendTo/PrependTo: extend a pathlist with an individual filepath.
